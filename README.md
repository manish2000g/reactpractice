## Project Architecture(MVC)
MVC is a software development approach which is commonly used to create user interfaces, data,
and control logic. It emphasizes the contrast between the business logic and the software's look.
This "division of responsibilities" provides for a more effective division of work and improved
management. A typical Android app consists of three major components which are:

i) Models:
The data that is shown is stored in models. Typically, this data is obtained via a network
or a local database. The information is then divided into compact, basic classes that
other components can use.

ii) Views:
The items that the user sees are referred to as views. They also handle any screen
interactions, such as click listeners, that a user could have. A view should only be used
to display data and not to carry out any business logic. As a result, the view is frequently
a lightweight component with less code than a controller. The responsibility for the
view is often transferred to activities and fragments in Android.

iii) Controllers:
Models and views are linked together via controllers. The controller modifies the model
whenever something happens in the view. The controller will refresh the view when
the model changes. Activities and fragments commonly feature the controller's duties.

## Provider as Statemanagement
The provider package is an easy to use package which is basically a wrapper around the InheritedWidgets that makes it easier to use and manage. It provides a state management technique that is used for managing a piece of data around the app.

## Challenges
The project's completion was hampered by a number of problems and difficulties. They are described as having an extremely large file size and a small number of tools and libraries. Password managers are not supported. Unpredictable crashes and mistakes disappoint. maintaining long-term activity while dealing with dart difficulties. After having to start the procedure over from scratch, the application's activity ends.
## Future Implementation
In future we can add two way authentication for login =. along with this we can also add billings for the products in cart and profile.
